      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Bailey. I'm 24 from Tacoma, WA and currently a Trainer for the Customer Service department of Regence BlueShield. I love to learn and challenge myself, which is why decided to start learning code. Outside of work, I  spend a lot of time outside, reading, trying out new art styles, playing video games, or just binge watching something on Netflix. Nice to meet you :)</p>
